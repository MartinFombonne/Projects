Searchable symmetric encryption (SSE) is a form of encryption that allows one to efficiently search over a collection of encrypted documents or files without the ability to decrypt them.[1][2] SSE can be used to outsource files to an untrusted cloud storage server without ever revealing the files in the clear but while preserving the server's ability to search over them. 

Description
A searchable symmetric encryption scheme is a symmetric-key encryption scheme that encrypts a collection of documents D = ( D 1 , … , D n ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {D} =(\mathrm {D_{1}} ,\dots ,\mathrm {D_{n}} )} {\displaystyle \mathbf {D} =(\mathrm {D_{1}} ,\dots ,\mathrm {D_{n}} )}, where each document D i ⊆ W {\displaystyle \mathrm {D_{i}} \subseteq \mathbb {W} } {\displaystyle \mathrm {D_{i}} \subseteq \mathbb {W} } is viewed as a set of keywords from a keyword space W. Given the encryption key K {\displaystyle K} K and a keyword w ∈ W {\displaystyle w\in \mathbb {W} } {\displaystyle w\in \mathbb {W} } w. The result of the search is the subset of encrypted documents that contain the keyword  w.
